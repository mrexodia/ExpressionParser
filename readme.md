# ExpressionParser

This is a very simple expression parser for binary operations with operator precedence, unary minus/plus and parentheses.

Sample input/output:

```
> 1+1
Result: 2
> 1--1
Result: 2
> 1^3
Result: 2
> ~89
Result: -90
> (1 + 6) * 3
Result: 21
```

This will be integrated in [x64dbg](http://x64dbg.com) once it is proven to be stable.
